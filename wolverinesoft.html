        <p>For the past two weeks, I was mainly in charge of narrative design. I designed a narrative system in the first week 
            and wrote documentation about it. I also had some idea about the UI layout for the ship builidng scene and 
            the combat scene. The overall workload for the first week was not too heavy since we didn't have a story yet. Some of my first week's work are shown below.

        <p>The design team accomplished a lot for the second week. We, as a team, held meetings during the week and nailed down the 
            structure of the tutorial, including ship building and combat. We also started a bit on settling on the tone and the story.
            I was mainly in charge of writing the narrative for the tutorial. This work turned out surprisingly tedious and time-consuming, and 
            I was only able to finish everything before the combat phase. I did a detailed diagram on Figma and I'm including a part of it below.
            Overall, I devoted much more time for the 2-credit, but I love what I am doing :)
